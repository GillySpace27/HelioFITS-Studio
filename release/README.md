# release/

The build and release tooling for HelioFITS Studio: the signed and notarized
macOS `.dmg`, the cross-platform `.zip`, and the field guide. The application
source is the repository root; nothing in this folder is application code.

**The full procedure, including the notarize-before-publish ordering and the
incident log, is in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).** Read it before shipping.

## What is here

- `deploy_release.sh`: the release pipeline, with the four modes below.
- `RELEASING.md`: the authoritative release procedure and the log of what has
  gone wrong.
- `build_guide.py`, `guide_content.json`, `guide_assets/`: the field guide.
  The script renders the prose in `guide_content.json` and the figures in
  `guide_assets/` into `HFStudio-Guide.pdf` and `HFStudio-Guide.md`.
- `make_app_icon.py`, `HFStudio_icon.icns`, `HFStudio_icon.ico`,
  `AppIcon.appiconset/`, `HFStudio_icon_1024.png`, `iris_plain_1024.png`: the
  app icon, its source art and the script that builds it. Lettered at 128 px and up, plain below, in an .icns for macOS
  and an .ico for Windows, plus the asset catalog source that
  `deploy_release.sh` compiles into the bundle so macOS does not put the icon on
  a grey plate.
- `fabric_suvi.json.gz`: the demo point cloud attached to every release.
- `skills/ship-hfstudio/`: the release tracker (`scripts/status.py`) and the
  assistant runbook that drives it.
- `hfstudio-dev-launcher.sh`: deprecated, kept in place (its header says so).
  It was the source of an older Dock tile, `/Applications/HFStudio Dev.app`,
  that ran `ant run` with one hardcoded Homebrew JDK. The current dev launcher
  is made by `extra/make-dev-launcher.sh`: `HelioFITS Studio (dev).app` in
  `~/Applications`, which fast-forwards master, runs `ant jar` and starts that
  jar. The release app is `HelioFITS Studio.app`, a different name, so the two
  sit side by side.

## Pipeline

```
./deploy_release.sh package    # regenerate the guide + repackage the zip locally (no network)
./deploy_release.sh guide      # re-upload only the guide PDF+MD to the GitHub release
./deploy_release.sh publish    # repackage + create the public release (zip + dmg + guide + demo cloud)
./deploy_release.sh notarize   # build a signed + notarized + stapled macOS .app inside a .dmg
```

The version is read from `../VERSION`. Assets are named `HFStudio-<version>.dmg`
and `HFStudio-<version>.zip`, and the release tag is `v<version>`. The GitHub
repository is set once, as `REPO` near the top of `deploy_release.sh`; the
tracker and the guide read it from there.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 25** for the build (`brew install openjdk@25`).
- `reportlab` for `build_guide.py`; Pillow and numpy for `make_app_icon.py`.
- For `notarize`: a full **Temurin 25** JDK (jpackage embeds it as the app's
  runtime, and Homebrew's `openjdk@25` ships without the needed jmods), an Apple
  **Developer ID Application** certificate, and a `notarytool` keychain profile
  named `jhv-notary`. Run it as `JAVA_HOME=<temurin-25> ./deploy_release.sh notarize`.

## Release

Releases: <https://github.com/GillySpace27/HelioFITS-Studio/releases>.
Shareable short link: <https://gilly.space/heliofits-studio>, a download page that asks GitHub
for the newest release each time it loads, with that index as the way back to older builds.

## History

Until the 0.8 pre-release this tooling lived in a separate repository,
`preview-deploy`, which built from a sibling `jhv-demo` worktree on the
`demo-all` branch. It moved here so the tooling and the source it packages are
versioned together. Older entries in `RELEASING.md` use the old names.

`build.xml` and `install4j/` used to live in this folder. They were upstream
JHelioviewer's packaging, they built a `JHelioviewer.jar` from a
`org.helioviewer.jhv.JHelioviewer` class that has not existed since the fork,
and nothing invoked them. Removed 2026-09-12; `git log` has them if a future
Windows or Linux installer wants the install4j media definitions back as a
starting point.
