# Package HelioFITS Studio for Windows or Linux with its own Java, so nobody has to install anything:
# the counterpart of what `deploy_release.sh notarize` builds for the Mac.
#
#   release/package-app.sh windows|linux|macos-x64     (run from the repository root, after `ant jar`)
#
# jpackage only builds for the system it runs on, which is why this runs in CI
# (.github/workflows/package.yml) rather than on the Mac. Output, named so the download page's
# platform tiles recognise it:
#   HFStudio-<version>-windows.zip     unzip anywhere, run HFStudio\HFStudio.exe
#   HFStudio-<version>-linux.tar.gz    untar anywhere, run HFStudio/bin/HFStudio
# An app-image rather than an installer: no WiX toolchain, no admin rights, nothing to uninstall.
# macos-x64 builds an UNSIGNED pkg-out/HFStudio.app and no archive: it exists so CI can start the
# Intel Mac build on an Intel Mac. The dmg people download is built and signed by
# `MAC_ARCH=x64 deploy_release.sh notarize`, which stages it the same way.
