"""Release progress tracker for HelioFITS Studio.

Checks REAL state: the jar's embedded revision against git, the dylib on disk,
the notarization ticket stapled into the dmg, the asset timestamps on the live
GitHub release. Never trusts what an earlier turn in the conversation claimed.

The load-bearing checks are `jar` and `published`.

`jar` compares the revision baked into HFStudio.jar's manifest
(`git rev-list --count HEAD` at build time) against the current HEAD count.
That number is the only provenance link between a shipped binary and its
source. It caught a real drift the day this tracker was written: jar 13211,
HEAD 13215.

`published` compares each live release asset's updatedAt against the local
file's mtime. `deploy_release.sh publish` builds nothing; it uploads whatever
is on disk, and on 2026-07-14 it silently left a month-old dmg on the release
while reporting success. Asset dates are the only thing that catches that.
