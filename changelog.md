# Revision history

## HelioFITS Studio 0.8.5 (unreleased)

### Starting
- A Welcome window opens on launch with the version, What's New for this version (read from the app itself, no network needed), and four ways to start: Continue, Start Blank, Open Session and Take the Tour. Help > Welcome to HelioFITS Studio reopens it, and a checkbox stops it opening at startup
- Startup can start blank instead of reopening the last session (in the Welcome window, or Settings under the startup state). A default session set from the File menu still opens first. A blank start keeps the last untitled session as "Untitled before blank start <date>" at the top of Open Recent
- Start New Session puts back the scene a fresh install opens with: the projection, the camera mode and the grid, viewpoint and timestamp settings reset too, not only the layer list
- An empty canvas says what to do: drop a FITS or JPEG 2000 file on it, or choose New Layer. The hint never appears in a recording or an export

### Finding things
- Help > Search Controls (Cmd-K, Ctrl-K elsewhere) finds any menu command or named control by its name or words from its tooltip. Enter runs the command, or opens the control's section or palette and points at it with the tour's spotlight
- File > Open Exports Folder, and a Show in Finder (Show in Folder elsewhere) button on the movie-ready and file-ready dialogs

### Presentation mode
- Presentation mode draws at the Recording pixel size and scales it to the projector, so the picture on the dome matches a recording
- With a second display, the main window stays on your screen exactly as it is, every control working, and the projector shows a full-screen mirror of its picture. The mirror is read back every frame the projector can paint, at the projector's resolution at most. This replaces the separate presenter window and its small preview

### Smaller fixes
- Double-clicking a layer slider (Opacity, Blend, Sharpen, Enhance, Upsilon, the alignment offsets) or the Projection palette's Warp, Disk and Field returns it to its default, the same value the section's revert uses, not to whatever it was when the panel was built
- The last five error and warning dialogs that lacked it (preset name, movie and layer date ranges, Levels in data units) now offer Report this...
- LASCO sessions record whether reading the headers for pointing finished, so a finished check is not repeated on every reopen and a failed one is tried again. Sessions saved before this with an empty pointing table check once

## HelioFITS Studio 0.8.4 (unreleased)

### Playback
- A movie plays without the mouse over the picture. One layer slower to decode than a movie frame used to hold the whole picture still until something else asked for a redraw, which in practice meant moving the mouse
- Every layer shows every frame. The movie waits on each frame until all layers have drawn it, so a slow layer such as a PUNCH mosaic with RHEF is no longer skipped; a layer that has not answered in two seconds is left behind for that frame so it cannot stop the movie
- Upcoming frames are decoded in parallel ahead of the playhead, so PUNCH with RHEF plays at the movie's own rate once the first frames are in. Decoded frames stay in memory, so a movie replays without decoding again
- Decoded frames may now use up to 40% of the computer's memory (at least 4 GB) instead of a fixed 8 GB. A 4096 x 4096 PUNCH movie of about a thousand frames needs about 31 GB; with 8 GB the cache filled partway through, then threw away frames decoded ahead of the playhead before they were shown, and playback fell to about 4 frames a second
- Frames are decoded ahead in whichever direction the movie is going, so a movie playing backwards or swinging, or a scrub to the left, gets the same lookahead as forward playback
- LASCO monthly backgrounds stay loaded (up to 64 of them) and load independently of one another. Every LASCO frame used to wait behind any background being fetched, and a two-month C2 and C3 session loaded its backgrounds 2,423 times
- PUNCH frames decode several times faster, with every value unchanged: RHEF works directly on the half-float image and sorts and ranks each ring with less work, and PUNCH's compressed tiles are unpacked by the app's own fast decoder. A first pass through a 4096 x 4096 PUNCH movie with RHEF and two LASCO layers now keeps up with 30 frames a second
- A movie plays at the rate set under Play. The clock used to schedule each frame from when the previous one actually fired, so every late frame delayed the rest, and 34 frames a second played at about 30. A Clock switch under Play keeps the old clock (Swing timer) for comparison with the new one (Fixed rate)

### Layers
- A Helioviewer layer longer than 1000 frames loads whole. Helioviewer builds at most 1000 frames per movie and thinned the cadence past that; such a request is now asked for in pieces of at most 900 frames that join into one layer. "Get all" still leaves the cadence to the server. Frame count now goes to 20000
- Levels shows the data values drawn as black and white wherever the layer has them (FITS layers without RHEF or a difference), and clicking them lets you type both. Other layers keep the percentages
- Reset All on an image layer's Layer Options header puts Display, Intensity and Geometry back to their defaults in one click, for every selected layer. The FITS clip and scale stay, as with Intensity's own revert
- The open hand shows only over image-layer rows; overlay and camera rows keep the arrow. Every row still drags to reorder

### Undo and redo
- Edit > Undo and Edit > Redo (Cmd-Z and Shift-Cmd-Z), and Undo and Redo buttons at the left of the toolbar. The menu names the step, such as "Undo Levels change" or "Undo Colormap change"
- A layer's colormap, Levels and other display settings, its filter, showing or hiding it, adding or removing a layer, the grid, the camera's settings, the projection, annotations, and the playback and recording settings can be undone. A drag is one step, taken when the mouse is released, and edits made in quick succession are one step. Up to 50 steps are kept
- Undoing a display change keeps the loaded movie; nothing is downloaded or read again. Undoing the removal of a layer reads its files back from the cache
- Not undone: changing what a layer loads (its time range, cadence or dataset), the master time range, timelines and automation tracks, PFSS, event, point-cloud and model layers, and panning or zooming the view
- Opening a session, Start New Session and Revert to Saved start a new history. While you are typing in a text field, Cmd-Z belongs to the field

### Sidebars
- Dragging either sidebar's edge resizes it. The width changed underneath but the layout did not follow, except when something unrelated happened to refresh it

### Downloaded data
- Files in the download cache (`~/HFStudio/FileCache`) are named after the file they came from, with a short hash before the extension, such as `PUNCH_L3_CAM_20260326062334_v0l_1a2b3c4d5e6f.fits`, so other programs can find and open them. Files cached by earlier versions are renamed the first time they are used again. An earlier version of HelioFITS Studio does not know the new names and downloads such a file again

### Export
- Every export says what made it: the build (version, revision and commit), when, from which data, and the whole scene. Movies carry it in their comment field, PNG frames in a text chunk named hfstudio, EXR frames in an hfstudio attribute beside jhv. Your home folder is written as ~
- Drop an exported PNG back on the window to reopen the scene it was made from. The scene is saved as a new session file beside your others and opened from there; nothing is overwritten
- File > Copy Provenance puts a block on the clipboard naming the build, the data and what to cite
- The timestamp layer's Annotations section has a Credit line, off by default, for talks and shows. With RHEF on it says the picture is not a calibrated radiance
- The About window shows the build as version, revision and commit, and says when it was built from uncommitted changes

### Help
- Help > Take the Tour points out the main controls one at a time: the picture, adding a layer, the layer list and its options, playback, the Timelines pane, Projection, recording, and where to find help. The rest of the window is dimmed while each control is shown. Esc leaves the tour; the arrow keys or Enter step through it
- The first launch offers the tour once, in a small card in the corner of the picture. Not now leaves it in the Help menu

### Feedback
- Help > Send Feedback... sends a problem, a request or a question to the developer from inside the app, with no account and no website. Tick boxes add system info and the last 300 lines of this run's log (on), the current session and a screenshot of the main window (off); Preview shows everything before it is sent, and your home folder is written as ~
- Error, warning and crash dialogs have a Report this... button that opens the same window with the message and, when there is one, the stack trace filled in
- This build has nowhere to send reports yet: they are saved in `~/HFStudio/Outbox`, with Copy to Clipboard and Email Instead offered, and a later version sends them when it starts. A sent report moves to `Outbox/sent`; none is deleted

## HelioFITS Studio 0.8.3 (pre-release, 2026-09-23)

### Multilayer FITS, including PUNCH
- FITS files that hold more than one image now load. PUNCH's polarized mosaics (PAM, PTM) carry two or three images in one file, and earlier builds refused them. Each image is named from the file's own `OBSLAYR` keywords, such as Polar_B and Polar_pB
- The first time such a file is loaded, HelioFITS Studio asks which image to show. Afterwards, the **Image** row in the layer's Display section, just below Color, switches between them. A saved session remembers the choice and does not ask again
- PUNCH files that are already downloaded load the same way, from the cache or from disk
- Known issue: while a layer is still downloading, the dropdowns in its options are hard to open and can close by themselves. Choose the image before starting a long download, or let the download finish first

### Loading
- Multi-frame FITS layers (PUNCH, LASCO, VSO) grow as they download. Each frame joins the movie and the timeline as it arrives, rather than everything appearing at the end, and the playhead stays where it is
- The layer's status says what is happening: Connecting, Restoring from cache, Downloading (frames downloaded and frames read from the cache counted separately, with the transfer rate), and Waiting on host when the archive has sent nothing for five seconds
- At most four frames download at once, so they finish one after another instead of all crawling in together
- Frames that fail to arrive are listed on the layer, and its Refresh button fetches them again
- The frame count sets how many LASCO and SUVI frames are requested from the VSO. It had been stuck near 97

### Display defaults
- FITS clipping defaults to the 0.5 % percentile instead of 0.001 %. The narrower range keeps PUNCH's polarized planes from rendering near white, at the cost of saturating slightly more of a bright coronagraph frame
- The HDR canvas is off until it is turned on, so a picture looks the same on a projector or in a screen share as on the Mac's own display
- Exports default to a square (1:1) frame
- The automatic crop frames the edge of the widest field rather than its corner, so a PUNCH mosaic fills the view (about 227 R☉ rather than 474)

### Projections
- The Crop is a circular cut at every warp setting. It used to renormalize the warp, which made it behave like a second zoom whenever the warp was not linear; now the warp stays fixed by the loaded data and the Crop only decides where the picture stops. A flat Helioradial figure made with both a crop and a non-linear warp will look different from before; with the warp linear nothing changes
- The radial grid lines up with the image under a warp in flat Helioradial, where it had been warped twice

### Comet tracking
- A Track Comet panel beside Track CME lists the comets that could be in the field during the movie, and marks where the chosen one is in each frame. The list follows the movie's time range

### Interface
- The layer options, Display and Intensity sections stay open
- Scrolling a sidebar scrolls it, instead of being caught by whichever slider or dropdown passes under the pointer
- A layer alone in the scene drives the movie, so it plays without first being selected
- The time-sync button sits with the layer's other buttons, beside Refresh
- When nothing loaded is in view, the timeline trims itself to the loaded data
- The movie no longer waits for the mouse when one layer is slow to deliver (the wait is capped at 120 ms), and a new layer's first picture appears as soon as it arrives
- Window > Log shows the log as it is being written. Load from Cache has moved to the Layers menu

### Name
- The application is called HelioFITS Studio again, and installs as `HelioFITS Studio.app`. HFStudio stays its technical name, as in 0.8.0 to 0.8.2: the downloads are still `HFStudio-<version>`, the settings folder is still `~/HFStudio` and SAMP still sees `HFStudio`, so nothing a 0.8.2 user has needs to move
- The repository is `GillySpace27/HelioFITS-Studio`, its original name, and the download page is `gilly.space/heliofits-studio`. Every earlier address forwards: the repository's names since September, and `/hfs`, `/hfstudio`, `/punchstudio`, `/jhv` and their capitalized forms on the site
- Between 2026-09-21 and 2026-09-23 the development builds were called PUNCHStudio. Nothing was released under that name; settings those builds wrote to `~/PUNCHStudio` are carried into `~/HFStudio` if that folder does not exist yet

### Icon
- The icon is the sun-pie iris again, lettered HFS: six wedges of the Sun at six wavelengths around a dark hexagon, an aperture made of solar images. It went to the HelioFITS plugin for a day and came back; HelioFITS keeps its AIA 171 Sun. A ladder of instrument rings was drawn for this release and dropped, because below 64 pixels it read as a grey target
- HFS is set at 128 pixels and above, the application's technical name as its downloads and settings folder carry it. At 64 and below the iris is plain, since letters there only smudge and the six wedges still read as a rosette. `release/iris_plain_1024.png` is the unlettered source art
- The Mac bundle now carries a compiled asset catalog as well as the .icns, because macOS 26 draws a .icns-only application on a grey plate at 16 and 32 pixels whatever its artwork does. The catalog is given the art unmasked, since macOS applies its own shape and insets anything that arrives already shaped
- Windows gets a .ico with the same per-size artwork, so its small icons are not shrunken copies of the large one either

### Fixes
- Restoring a session with LASCO layers no longer re-reads every header. 0.8.1 saved what the pointing probe concluded but only believed it back if it had found something to lend, and a movie clear of the 2025-08 gap has nothing to lend, so the usual case probed again on every restore
- `-state` opens a session and the window now belongs to it, so autosave and quit write back to that file. It used to load the named session but keep saving to whichever session the window remembered from the previous launch, so opening A and quitting wrote A's scene over B

## HFStudio 0.8.2 (pre-release, 2026-09-19)

A new name and icon, and a download for every platform that carries its own Java.

### Name and icon
- Rename the application to HFStudio. HelioFITS Studio was too easily confused with the HelioFITS preview plugin. The repository is now `GillySpace27/HFStudio`, and GitHub forwards the old addresses
- Register with SAMP as `HFStudio`, so a script that finds the application by its old name needs the new one
- A new icon that fills the macOS squircle and reads HFS. macOS 26 had been shrinking the old one onto a grey plate on every fresh install

### Downloads
- A signed and notarized dmg for Intel Macs beside the Apple Silicon one, built from an Intel JDK and tested under Rosetta, not yet on an Intel Mac
- Windows and Linux packages that carry their own Java, attached to the release by CI only once each has started, drawn an image and decoded a JPEG 2000 file with its bundled OpenJPEG. Nobody has used them on real hardware yet, and the Windows build is not code-signed, so SmartScreen warns on first run
- Every package carries a trimmed Java runtime and only its own platform's native libraries, roughly halving it: the Mac app bundle goes from 319 MB to 153 MB

### Fixes
- Changing the filter with two or more image layers selected no longer throws
- When a computer's graphics cannot start (Metal, Direct3D 11 or OpenGL), HFStudio says so in words and says where the log is, instead of showing a stack trace
- The log records which OpenJPEG was loaded, and from where

## HFStudio 0.8.1 (pre-release, 2026-09-18)

Fixes found in use of 0.8.0, mostly on LASCO and PUNCH data, and a clearer layer options panel.

### Coronagraph data
- LASCO frames whose header lost its pointing keep the borrowed roll when a session is restored, not only when the data is first queried; a movie across the 2025-08 C2 gap no longer flips 178° partway through. The borrowed pointing is saved with the session, so a restore needs no extra header reads
- The mask reaches the whole field of wide-field data: masks were capped at 32 R☉, so on a PUNCH mosaic the outer handle blanked the image one step from the top and the inner handle stopped halfway
- The mask slider rescales once a layer's first frame arrives, rather than keeping a 0 to 1 R☉ scale for the session
- Sector direction and opening apply to every selected layer, like the other rows, each keeping its own other half

### Display
- Grid: a dashed solar limb circle that faces the camera from any angle, to show where the Sun is and how big, and a Main grid switch that hides the grid itself (or the helioradial rings and spokes) while leaving the other overlays up
- A layer's options are grouped into sections whose headers say what each one holds and what is changed
- Switching theme no longer crashes from the macOS menu bar, and the playhead strip, the cache dialog's status line and the CACTus Track button follow the new theme without a restart

## HFStudio 0.8.0 (pre-release, 2026-09-16)

The first pre-release under its own name (then HelioFITS Studio), for testing ahead of 1.0. It joins the PUNCH and coronagraph work of the preview builds with upstream JHelioviewer's development through 14 September 2026 in a single line. Every entry from this heading down to the JHelioviewer 5.5.0 heading belongs to this release.

### Consolidation
- Merge upstream JHelioviewer's timeline overhaul (HAPI catalogs, stacked and predefined plots, warning levels), its export refactor with failure reporting, the LWJGL and ANGLE updates, toolbar visibility and timeline maximize controls, and its grid allocation work
- Native LASCO FITS from NRL take their CROTA, so frames recorded while SOHO is rolled are no longer upside down; Helioviewer's pre-rotated LASCO JP2s are left as they are
- LASCO frames whose header lost its pointing borrow it from the nearest frame of either telescope (C2 CROTA is C3's plus 0.732°), and every borrow is logged
- Give PUNCH mosaics an inner occulter radius so their no-data center no longer paints an opaque disk over layers beneath (by @GillySpace27)
- Native PUNCH mosaics, which name PUNCH only in OBSRVTRY, get that inner occulter too
- Every product code in the PUNCH dialog explains itself on hover
- Grid labels and viewpoint markers keep their share of the frame in exported movies and images
- The update check reads the released VERSION file; it used to build a malformed address
- Decode JPEG 2000 with OpenJPEG instead of Kakadu, whose non-commercial licence does not reach a fork: the JPIP cache, the codestream rebuild, the box reader, the image source and the decoder are all new, and a fully delivered frame decodes pixel for pixel identically to the same frame's file
- Frame a newly opened dataset the way Reset View does, with View > Reset View for New Layers to turn it off
- Rename the application's threads, default export name, icon and launch scripts to HelioFITS Studio, and move files that belonged to upstream JHelioviewer or to the preview builds into `archive/`

## JHelioviewer 5.11.0 (pending)

### Display and rendering
- Add glTF/GLB model layers with surfaces, lines, points, textures, transparency, and lighting

- Improve thick-line joins, rectangle corners, annotation loops, and FOV outline rendering
- Improve flat-grid stability and grid label formatting
- Adjust trajectory colors for white canvas (fixes #260)
- Add a `New PUNCH Layer` source that loads FITS frames from the PUNCH archive at `umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/punch` (by @GillySpace27)
- Add `RHEF` radial histogram equalizing filter with an Upsilon midtone control (by @GillySpace27)
- Add `RadialWarp` (circular) and `RectWarp` (angle versus solar distance)
  wide-field views with λ-controlled outer-corona compression while keeping
  the solar disk linear (λ = 1 linear, 0 logarithmic, −1 strongest), replacing
  the redundant Polar and LogPolar projections (by @GillySpace27)
- Add grid line color, opacity and width controls to the grid layer (by @GillySpace27)
- Show the application's own icon in the macOS Dock and the Windows taskbar instead of the generic Java icon
- Add `Track CME`: animate the warp lambda so a CACTus CME front stays at a fixed screen radius while the corona rubber-bands around it; engage from a CACTus event dialog or the Track picker, disengage by moving the lambda slider or leaving the warp projections
- Add a SWEK option to extend CACTus CME wedges past the LASCO catalog edge, out to the loaded field of view
- Add a cadence control and a large-download confirmation to the ASPIICS layer dialog
- Add a double-ended radial mask (inner disk and outer corona) to the layer options
- Add a per-layer refresh button to check the PUNCH archive for new frames
- Pin a multi-frame FITS layer to one shared display range so a PUNCH movie does not strobe as each frame auto-normalizes
- Improve FITS WCS interpretation of angular units, including surface maps,
  and full `PCi_j` and `CDi_j` linear transformations
- Add image-layer controls for outer-radius masking and for sector direction and opening

  replacing, and synchronizing image layers
- Add a Movie menu command and `Cmd-R` shortcut to start or stop recording
- Add controls to collapse the sidebar and hide the status bar, the toolbar, or the toolbar text
- Show the original image URI in the Image Information dialog
- Improve HEK event handling by mapping Flare Trigger events to Flare events
  (fixes #105) and fixing CACTus event loading (fixes #190)
- Improve SWEK supplier filtering and configuration, loading, paging, storage,
  cancellation, indexing, and highlight dispatch
- Disable COMESEP event source
- Improve layer-table update/repaint behavior when layer names or metadata change

### Performance and data

  coordinate preparation, from the rendering thread
- Reduce allocations in status panels, grid labels, FITS scaling, time maps, and interpolation paths
- Update bundled libraries, FFmpeg (9.0.1), SPICE kernels, and supporting build tools

### Technical
