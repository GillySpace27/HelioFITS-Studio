/**
 * The left sidebar as a home for palettes: the four panes it starts with can be popped out into
 * windows, and any palette can be dropped back into it.
 *
 * <p>The right sidebar owns its own scroller, handle and width. This one does not own anything: it
 * is a thin cover over the pane MainFrame already built, which is why it is a separate class rather
 * than a second instance of {@link RightSidebar}. The difference that follows is worth stating.
 * That pane is SHARED. The plugins add their own sections to it directly (Timeline Layers, the
 * Space Weather Event Knowledgebase), so this must never rebuild the stack: a section pops out with
 * its position remembered and is inserted back at that index, leaving everything around it alone.
 *
 * <p>The reorder arrows move a section past whatever is next to it, a plugin's section included.
 * Confining them to the palettes was the first instinct and it is the wrong one: it would leave a
 * section that refuses to pass the one above it for reasons nothing on screen explains. What they
 * must not do is rebuild the stack, and they do not: SideContentPane moves the one pane and leaves
 * every other child of the shared pane exactly where it was.
