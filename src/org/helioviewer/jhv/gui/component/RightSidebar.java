/**
 * A second sidebar, on the right, holding the control palettes as sections instead of as floating
 * windows.
 *
 * <p>Same affordances as the left one: a handle that collapses it with a click and resizes it with
 * a drag, and both the width and the collapsed state remembered across launches. It differs in
 * what it is FOR, and so in one behaviour. The left sidebar's contents are fixed and it measures
 * itself to them (see MainFrame.stabilizeLeftPaneWidth, which sizes to the widest the image-layer
 * pane will ever be). This one holds whatever the user has put in it, which changes as palettes
 * are docked and floated, so it has no natural width to measure: it takes the width it is given
 * and its sections scroll.
 *
 * <p>It shows only when it holds something. An empty rail down the side of the window would be a
 * permanent reminder of a feature not in use, and with every palette floating there is nothing for
 * it to say.
 *
 * <p>The mirror image of the left sidebar in two places worth stating, because both are easy to
 * get backwards: the handle sits on the LEFT of the content rather than the right, and a drag to
 * the left WIDENS it, so the width moves against the pointer's x rather than with it.
